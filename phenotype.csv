Optic glioma arises from glial cells within the optic nerve and there is no clear separation between the nerve and the tumor; hence the tram-track sign is not seen in optic gliomas. Calcification may be seen in optic nerve sheath meningiomas in 20-50% of cases and hence the tram-track sign may be seen on nonenhanced CT scan images as a linear calcification around the nerve, but this is less common.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HP:0031586,Tessier number 14 facial cleft,"This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa.

There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse.

The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve.

Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome.

The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric.

The overlying tissue shows a vertical sclerodermic furrow radiating from the labial commissure or the angle of the mandible across the cheek to a coloboma of the lower eyelid between the middle and lateral one-third. Microphthalmia is not observed. The skeletal cleft is between the maxilla and zygoma; it passes through the inferolateral orbital rim to enter the inferior orbital fissure. No alveolar cleft is present. The zygomatic arch is intact. The soft tissue furrow, which is more apparent on the right, radiates from the oral commissure toward the lateral two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The antimongoloid obliquity of the palpebral fissures is associated with laterally placed lower eyelid clefts and some ectropion. A left-sided anophthalmia is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue hypoplasia and is reflected in a short palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and minor ptosis of the eyebrow. No abnormality is present in the alveolar arch except for some tilting of the occlusal plane secondary to hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla. There is a vertical bony groove in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture that ends in the inferolateral portion of a small bony orbit. More laterally, the remainder of the zygomatic body and arch is normal in both shape and dimension. The lateral orbital floor is downslanting but intact, and it lacks direct communication with the temporal or infratemporal fossae. The hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla and orbit is associated with a reduction in the transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the anterior cranial fossa; mild asymmetry of the middle cranial fossa and calvarium is present.

There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline.

The lacrimal system and inner canthus are normal. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline.

The cleft continues superiorly to involve the inner canthus and lower eyelid medial to the inferior lacrimal punctum, thereby disrupting the nasolacrimal system. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side.

Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions.
