# AI-Powered-Rare-Disease-Discovery-

Rare genetic diseases affect millions of patients worldwide, many of whom experience a prolonged
“diagnostic odyssey,” often lasting 5–7 years before receiving an accurate diagnosis. This project presents
an AI-powered diagnostic assistant designed to accelerate rare disease discovery by intelligently
linking clinical symptoms to potential genetic mutations. The proposed system integrates Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to analyze multimodal medical data. Clinical notes
and laboratory results are processed using Random Forest classification to identify meaningful symptom
clusters associated with rare disorders. In parallel, facial phenotyping is performed using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze patient facial images, as many genetic conditions
exhibit distinctive craniofacial features that may not be easily detected by human observation. By
combining symptom-based analysis with computer vision insights, the system generates a ranked list of
the most likely candidate genes for targeted genetic testing. This approach reduces unnecessary
testing, lowers diagnostic costs, and minimizes emotional stress for patients and families. A
privacy-first design is employed, incorporating data de-identification techniques to ensure patient
anonymity and secure handling of sensitive medical and facial data. The proposed model demonstrates
the potential of AI-driven decision support systems to significantly reduce diagnostic time from years to
minutes, enabling earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.
